- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eric Kemmeren,
- Welcome to my Github page where I have many project, from self made [smart curtains](https://github.com/GoodGuyMe/rolgordijnen) to snake playing on a [LED table](https://github.com/GoodGuyMe/esp32-table).
- All these project connect to a MQTT server, running on a raspberry pi together with [Openhab](https://www.openhab.org/) to control all the systems.
- Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at the TU Delft.
